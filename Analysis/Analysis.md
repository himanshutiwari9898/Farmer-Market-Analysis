# Farmers Market Dashboard – Analysis & Insights

## Overall Market Performance
- Total sales of approximately 8.67K are generated from a relatively small
  set of transactions, indicating a compact but active market.
- The market serves 1,003 total customers, but only 29 customers actively
  contribute to recorded sales, showing that revenue is driven by a small
  active customer base.
- With 9 vendors operating across 7 booths, vendor participation is limited,
  making individual vendor performance highly impactful on total sales.

## Vendor Performance
- Sales are entirely concentrated under a single vendor in the current view,
  indicating either a strong top-performing vendor or filtered analysis.
- This concentration suggests vendor dominance, where one vendor captures
  the full share of sales under selected conditions.
- Vendor-level performance analysis is critical, as changes in vendor activity
  can significantly affect total market revenue.

## Product Sales Insights
- Product sales are unevenly distributed, with one product contributing the
  highest share of total sales (~3.2K), followed closely by another at ~2.8K.
- Lower-performing products contribute significantly less revenue, indicating
  clear differences in customer product preference.
- Focusing inventory and promotion on high-performing products could improve
  overall sales efficiency.

## Customer Behavior
- Sales are unevenly distributed across customers, with a small number of
  customers generating the highest individual sales values.
- This indicates the presence of high-value customers who contribute more
  per transaction compared to the rest of the customer base.
- Targeting and retaining these high-value customers could increase total
  revenue without increasing customer count.

## Quantity-Based Analysis
- Total quantity sold is approximately 2.96K units, with product-level
  quantities showing clear variation.
- One product leads in quantity sold (over 1.1K units), while others lag
  significantly, reinforcing product preference trends observed in sales.
- High sales value does not always directly align with highest quantity,
  suggesting price differences across products.

## Geographic (Zip Code) Trends
- Sales and quantity vary significantly across customer zip codes.
- One zip code shows substantially higher sales and quantity contribution,
  indicating localized demand concentration.
- Geographic targeting could be leveraged for marketing or booth placement
  strategies.

## Business Implications
- Revenue and quantity are driven by a small set of vendors, products, and
  customers, highlighting dependency risk.
- Product assortment optimization and focused inventory management can
  improve both sales and quantity performance.
- Vendor diversification and customer engagement strategies could reduce
  over-reliance on limited contributors and stabilize market performance.
